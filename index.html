  <h4 class="post-title">History</h4>
  <div class="content-ver-sep"> </div>
  <div class="entrytext">
    <p>The Foothills Men’s Chorus was founded in 2005 as a small group of men who just loved to sing! We were brought together through the inspiration and efforts of Phillip Pack (director 2005-2007) and are currently directed by Tim Korthuis (2007-present).</p>
    <p>We have grown in number and skill, performing before a variety of audiences both locally and provincially. We present a very diverse repertoire, that includes sacred, classic, folk and popular music, as well as performing in several languages (Italian, Latin, French, German, Korean, Croatian). The Chorus is fortunate to have an enthusiastic and dedicated director in Tim Korthuis, as well as a very talented accompanist in Heather Haaland. The FMC regularly supports local performers by collaborating in the Men's Chorus Annual Spring Concerts, including local elementary, junior and senior high schools, as well as the Alberta Dance Academy, and has a full performance schedule each season with local groups and venues. Men of all ages are invited to join the group each season!</p>
